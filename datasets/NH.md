## FY 2024 SNF VBP Aggregate Performance
This table contains national, aggregate-level results for the fiscal year (FY) 2024 Skilled Nursing Facility Value-Based Purchasing (SNF VBP) Program. Included are unadjusted national average readmission rates for the baseline period (FY 2019) and performance period (FY 2022), the achievement threshold and benchmark (that is, the performance standards for the FY 2024 SNF VBP Program year), and information on performance scores, incentive payment multipliers, value-based incentive payments (in dollars), and the total number of SNFs receiving value-based incentive payments for the FY 2024 SNF VBP Program year.<br /><br />Note: SNFs that did not meet the SNFRM’s case minimum (25 or more eligible stays) in the performance period (FY 2022) are excluded from the SNF VBP Program for FY 2024. Payments to these SNFs in FY 2024 will not be affected by the SNF VBP Program; instead, these SNFs will receive their adjusted federal per diem rate. CMS will not publicly report any data for the FY 2024 SNF VBP Program year for these excluded SNFs.

## COVID-19 Vaccination Rates - State and National Averages
State and National averages for facility resident and healthcare personnel COVID-19 vaccination rates. Data are presented as one row per state or territory plus a row for national averages.<br /><br />Note: On January 1, 2024, the CDC changed the data collection methodology for the percent of staff who are up to date with their COVID-19 vaccination. It may take facilities some time to adapt to the new methodology. As a result, the reported percent of staff who are up to date with their COVID-19 vaccination should be viewed with caution over the next few weeks. Consumers or interested parties should contact facilities directly for more information on their vaccination levels.
