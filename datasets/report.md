## Medicare Spending Per Beneficiary - National
The Medicare Spending Per Beneficiary (MSPB) Measure shows whether Medicare spends more, less, or about the same for an episode of care (episode) at a specific hospital compared to all hospitals nationally. An MSPB episode includes Medicare Part A and Part B payments for services provided by hospitals and other healthcare providers the 3 days prior to, during, and 30 days following a patient's inpatient stay. This measure evaluates hospitals' costs compared to the costs of the national median (or midpoint) hospital. This measure takes into account important factors like patient age and health status (risk adjustment) and geographic payment differences (payment-standardization). The numbers displayed here are: 1) the average MSPB measure for the nation; and 2) the national episode-weighted median MSPB amount used as the denominator in the calculation of each hospital's MSPB measure.
