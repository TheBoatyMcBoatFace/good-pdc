## Healthcare Associated Infections - National
The Healthcare-Associated Infections (HAI) measures - national data. These measures are developed by Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and collected through the National Healthcare Safety Network (NHSN). They provide information on infections that occur while the patient is in the hospital. These infections can be related to devices, such as central lines and urinary catheters, or spread from patient to patient after contact with an infected person or surface. Many healthcare associated infections can be prevented when the hospitals use CDC-recommended infection control steps.

## Medicare Spending Per Beneficiary - State
The Medicare Spending Per Beneficiary (MSPB) Measure shows whether Medicare spends more, less, or about the same for an episode of care (episode) at a specific hospital compared to all hospitals nationally. An MSPB episode includes Medicare Part A and Part B payments for services provided by hospitals and other healthcare providers the 3 days prior to, during, and 30 days following a patient's inpatient stay. This measure evaluates hospitals' costs compared to the costs of the national median (or midpoint) hospital. This measure takes into account important factors like patient age and health status (risk adjustment) and geographic payment differences (payment-standardization). The data displayed here are the average measures for each state.

## Medicare Spending Per Beneficiary - National
The Medicare Spending Per Beneficiary (MSPB) Measure shows whether Medicare spends more, less, or about the same for an episode of care (episode) at a specific hospital compared to all hospitals nationally. An MSPB episode includes Medicare Part A and Part B payments for services provided by hospitals and other healthcare providers the 3 days prior to, during, and 30 days following a patient's inpatient stay. This measure evaluates hospitals' costs compared to the costs of the national median (or midpoint) hospital. This measure takes into account important factors like patient age and health status (risk adjustment) and geographic payment differences (payment-standardization). The numbers displayed here are: 1) the average MSPB measure for the nation; and 2) the national episode-weighted median MSPB amount used as the denominator in the calculation of each hospital's MSPB measure.

## Safety and Healthcare-Associated Infection Measures - PPS-Exempt Cancer Hospital
Prospective Payment System (PPS)-Exempt Cancer Hospital Quality Reporting (PCHQR) Program Healthcare Associated Infections. These measures are developed by Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and collected through the National Healthcare Safety Network (NHSN). They provide information on infections that occur while the patient is in the hospital. These infections can be spread from patient to patient after contact with an infected person or surface. Many healthcare associated infections can be prevented when the hospitals use CDC-recommended infection control steps.

## Medicare Spending Per Beneficiary - Hospital
The Medicare Spending Per Beneficiary (MSPB) Measure shows whether Medicare spends more, less, or about the same for an episode of care (episode) at a specific hospital compared to all hospitals nationally. An MSPB episode includes Medicare Part A and Part B payments for services provided by hospitals and other healthcare providers the 3 days prior to, during, and 30 days following a patient's inpatient stay. This measure evaluates hospitals' costs compared to the costs of the national median (or midpoint) hospital. This measure takes into account important factors like patient age and health status (risk adjustment) and geographic payment differences (payment-standardization).

## Hospital-Acquired Condition (HAC) Reduction Program
Hospital-Acquired Condition (HAC) Reduction Program (HACRP) - In October 2014, CMS began reducing Medicare fee-for-service payments for subsection (d) hospitals that rank in the worst-performing quartile with respect to hospital-acquired condition (HAC) quality measures. Hospitals with a Total HAC Score above the 75th percentile of the Total HAC Score distribution will be subject to a 1-percent payment reduction. This table contains hospitals' measure and Total HAC scores. The Total HAC Score is calculated as the equally weighted average of hospitals' individual measure scores.

## Hospital Readmissions Reduction Program
In October 2012, CMS began reducing Medicare payments for subsection(d) hospitals with excess readmissions under the Hospital Readmissions Reduction Program (HRRP). Excess readmissions are measured by a ratio, calculated by dividing a hospital's predicted rate of readmissions for heart attack (AMI), heart failure (HF), pneumonia, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), hip/knee replacement (THA/TKA), and coronary artery bypass graft surgery (CABG) by the expected rate of readmissions, based on an average hospital with similar patients.
