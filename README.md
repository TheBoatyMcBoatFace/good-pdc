[![Link Checker](https://github.com/TheBoatyMcBoatFace/good-pdc/actions/workflows/link_checker.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/TheBoatyMcBoatFace/good-pdc/actions/workflows/link_checker.yml)

This project periodically checks various links on CMS's Provider Data Catalog (PDC) to ensure that all links are operational and all data is accessible.

**THIS IS NOT AN OFFICIAL GOVERNMENT CODEBASE**.

Check the [Archives.md](Archives.md) file to see the status summary and detailed reports of each data topic archive.

To see the datasets, go to [Datasets README](datasets/README.md).

## What it do?

- **Link Validation**: We check CMS PDC links to make sure they're not ghosting üëª us.

- **Categorized Reports**: We neatly categorize this info in `Archives.md` and associated dataset markdown files. _I'm really proud of how this turned out._
- **Dataset Analysis**: We test archive files and all datasets on the PDC. The datasets are analyzed, and basic checks are performed on them.
- **Public Data Check**: Uses the PDC API to find the archive and dataset files and then checks to make sure they exist.
- **Summarized Status**: A quick glance at the top tells you if things are going smoothly or if there's trouble.
- **Detailed Dataset Reports**: To view the dataset results, go to `datasets/README.md` where you can find links to various data topics.
- **GitHub Actions**: Automatically keeps things in check every time you push to the `main` branch. It also runs every three hours and sends notifications if there is a ‚ùå in the results file.
- **Error and Performance Monitoring**: Uses Sentry for error and performance monitoring. If you don't want to use it, just don't set `SENTRY_DSN` to any variable.
- **Logging Levels**: Select your log level by setting `LOG_LEVEL`. Options are `error`, `warn`, `info`, `debug`, `trace`.

## How It Works

### Dataset Reports

The dataset reports are generated using a Rust module that performs the following tasks:

1. **Fetching Datasets**
   - The module fetches a list of datasets from the PDC API.
   - Datasets are deserialized into a `Dataset` struct.

2. **Processing Datasets**
   - Each dataset is processed in parallel to improve efficiency.
   - The module checks the status of the dataset's download URL and landing page.

3. **Generating Reports**
   - The module constructs a markdown report for each dataset, including:
     - Dataset details (e.g., ID, title, description, issued date, modified date, release date).
     - File history and overview (e.g., filesize, row count, column count).
     - Data integrity tests (e.g., column count consistency, header validation, encoding validation).
     - Public access tests (e.g., status of PDC page, landing page, and direct download link).
   - Reports are saved to the `datasets` directory.

4. **Error Handling and Logging**
   - The module uses Sentry for error tracking and performance monitoring.
   - Detailed logging is performed using the `tracing` crate.

### Archive Reports

The archive reports are generated using another Rust module that performs the following tasks:

1. **Fetching Archives**
   - The module fetches a list of archive topics from the PDC API.
   - Archive topics are deserialized into a `Topics` struct.

2. **Processing Archives**
   - Each archive is processed to check the status of yearly and monthly archive URLs.
   - The module generates a summary of the yearly and monthly archive checks.

3. **Generating Reports**
   - The module constructs a markdown report for each archive topic, including:
     - Archive details and statuses.
     - Summary of yearly and monthly archive checks.
   - Reports are saved to the `Archives.md` file.

4. **Error Handling and Logging**
   - The module uses Sentry for error tracking and performance monitoring.
   - Detailed logging is performed using the `tracing` crate.


## Getting Started

1. **Clone the repo**:

    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/TheBoatyMcBoatFace/good-pdc.git
    cd good-pdc
    ```

2. **Run locally**:

    ```sh
    cargo run
    ```

3. **Vibe Check**:

    Open up `Archives.md` and see if there are any ‚ùå, _Hint: those are bad_

4. **Automate with GitHub Actions**:

    Push to `main` to run the bot thing. It also runs every three hours and sends notifications if there is a ‚ùå in the results file.

## Contributing

You're awesome for wanting to help (just saying). Here are some guidelines:

1. **Open issues**: If you find bugs or have cool ideas, open an issue. No issue = it doesn't exist.

2. **Don't be a jerk**: I am not afraid to use the ban üî®. GitHub is the best social media platform, don't ruin it.
